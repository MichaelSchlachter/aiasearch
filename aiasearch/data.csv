A743607,INTEXT,Amendment to a Long Form,Interior/Exterior Work,"E -Plan The Elevator Lobby was designed with a minimum dimension of 8 feet. However, an additional wood veneer will be added to the walls, creating a minimum dimension of 7’9”. This dimension and veneer addition can be seen in the diagram attached to the bottom of the letter in the electronic plans attachment. According to Section 403.6.1 of 780 CMR 8th Edition, buildings more than 70 feet in height above grade plane must provide a minimum of one fire service access elevator in accordance with Section 3007. Section 3007.4.4 states that the elevator lobby is permitted a minimum dimension of 8 feet. 32 Derne Street is 90 feet in height and therefore must comply with these requirements. The 9th Edition 780 CMR is anticipated to be adopted within the next few months. According to the 9th Edition, and the 2015 IBC, a fire service access elevator is not required unless the building is more than 120 feet in height. The Fifth Floor of 32 Derne Street is new construction and could therefore fall under the 9th Edition. Under the 9th Edition, a fire service access elevator is not required and therefore, the minimum dimension of 7’9” would be permitted.
